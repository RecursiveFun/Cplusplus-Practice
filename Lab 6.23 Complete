/*
6.23 LAB: Contains the character
Write a program that reads an integer, a list of words, and a character. The integer signifies how many words are in the list. The output of the program is every word in the list that contains the character at least once. For coding simplicity, follow each output word by a comma, even the last one. Add a newline to the end of the last output. Assume at least one word in the list will contain the given character.

Ex: If the input is:

4 hello zoo sleep drizzle z
then the output is:

zoo,drizzle,
To achieve the above, first read the list into a vector. Keep in mind that the character 'a' is not equal to the character 'A'.

int main() {
int inputNum;

cin >> inputNum; //Get number of inputs being provided
vector<string> listOfWords(inputNum); //Create vector size based on inputNum


for (i = 0; i < inputNum; ++i) { //Add string elements to vector
   cin >> userInput;
   listOfWords.at(i) = userInput;
}
//Get search character
   cin >> userInput;

//Search for last input character and return any words with a matching char followed by a comma
for(i = 0; i < inputNum; ++i) {
   string temp = listOfWords.at(i); //Assign a temporary value for each string in the vector for every iteration
   for (int j = 0; j < temp.size(); ++j) {
      if(temp[j] == userInput[0]) {
         if (count == 0) { //Check to see if string was already printed by keeping count.
         cout << listOfWords.at(i) << ',';
         count++;
         }
      }
   }
count = 0; //Reset counter to 0 for each string 
}
cout << endl;

   return 0;
