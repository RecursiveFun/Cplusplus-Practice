5.15 LAB: Varied amount of input data
Statistics are often calculated with varying amounts of input data. Write a program that takes any number of non-negative integers as input, and outputs the max and average. A negative integer ends the input and is not included in the statistics. Assume the input contains at least one non-negative integer.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements.

Ex: When the input is:

15 20 0 3 -1
the output is:

20 9.50

int main() {

int stringToInt;
int max = 0;
double sum = 0;
int count = 0;
double average;

// userInputs any number of non-negative integers, a negative integer ends the input and is not included in the stats
   while (true) {
   cin >> stringToInt;
   if (stringToInt < 0) {
   break;
   }
   sum = sum + stringToInt;
   count = count + 1;
   average = sum / count;
      if (stringToInt > max) {
      max = stringToInt;
      }
   }

cout << fixed << setprecision(2);

// Output max and average of userInputs
cout << max << " " << average << endl;
